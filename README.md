# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- You need to write the following commands on the terminal screen(in vscode) so that you can run this project locally.

    git clone "https://github.com/Rohit-108/food-app.git"

- Go to the project directory
    cd food-app

- install dependencies

 npm install

- start the server

 npm run dev
